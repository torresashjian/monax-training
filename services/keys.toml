Eris keys is meant for quick prototyping. You must replace it with a hardened key signing daemon to use in production. Eris does not intend to harden this for production, but rather will keep it as a rapid prototyping server.

This service is usually linked to a chain and/or an application. Its functionality is wrapped by [eris keys].
